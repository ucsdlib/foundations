<h2>A quick intro to learner-centered design</h2>

<p>Learner-centered design places <em>learners</em> and <em>learning</em> at the center of the design process. The focus is on helping learners achieve their goals, breaking down complex challenges into manageable parts, and fostering memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning.</p>

<p>This mini-course takes a "learn-by-doing" approach to learner-centered design by providing you and your team with a quick and practical design process and toolkit.</p>

<p>You'll start by creating an empathy map to help you center your design around learners and their goals. From there, you and your team will develop and refine learning outcomes, and start prototyping!</p>
