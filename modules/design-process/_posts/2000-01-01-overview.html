<h2>A quick intro to user experience</h2>

<p>User-centered design places users at the center of the design process. The focus is on helping users meet needs, breaking down complex challenges into manageable parts, and fostering memorable, meaningful, and impactful experiences.</p>

<p>This mini-course takes a "learn-by-doing" approach to user-centered design by providing you and your team with a quick and practical design process and toolkit.</p>

<p>You'll start by creating an empathy map to help you center your design around users and their goals. From there, you and your team will develop and refine your design process, and start prototyping!</p>

<p>Here are a couple of resources about User-Centered design to help you get started:</p>
