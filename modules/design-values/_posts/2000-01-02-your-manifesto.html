    <ul>
        <li>Review the work you have done in your notebook and with your team so far. As you read through the work you have done so far, think about the following questions: What values will guide your work? What inspires you most about learning and teaching? What challenges do you anticipate and how will you overcome them?</li>
        <li>Jot down a preliminary list of ideas for your own personal design manifesto.</li>
        <li>Try to list at least 5 or more items that you are passionate about and that can help you with your design process.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Notice how each manifesto item can help address common challenges with the creative process. For example, declaring that you want to "build imperfect solutions quickly and on purpose" can help you address the common challenge of perfectionism. Declaring that you want to "work with what you have" can help you encourage a DIY approach.</li>
