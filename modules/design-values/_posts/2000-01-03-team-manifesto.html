<h2>Your team's design manifesto.</h2>

<p>What values will guide your team's work? When faced with challenging decisions, too many options, or not enough paths forward, what will you do?</p>

<p>Values-driven design can help you and your team overcome the most difficult challenges. And co-articulating shared values with your team is an inspiring way to launch a design process.</p>
<p>Review some of our organization's Team Manifestos below:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>&#128158; <strong>Empathize and design for all.</strong> Our goal is to understand the feelings and experiences of our users to create inclusive content and designs that solve problems or fulfill needs for people of all backgrounds and abilities. We connect with users by asking meaningful questions and active listening, while also suspending judgment and remaining conscious of implicit biases. </li>
        <li>&#128172; <strong>Iterate through feedback.</strong> No solution is perfect — we remain open to iteration and refinement for everything we create. We openly seek and receive feedback, from both within the organization and from external users, to improve every stage of the design process. By using a mixed-methods approach of lived experiences and observed data, we can reach a solution reflective of user needs and experiences.</li>
        <li>&#129309; <strong>Build Community.</strong> We build relationships with people, both internal and external to the Library, so that all UC San Diego community members find connection with and are represented in the Library’s content and designs. Through iterative communication and feedback, we have the opportunity to strengthen the Library’s role as a resource and community partner in every project.</li>
        <li>&#x1F3A8; <strong>Champion creativity and innovation.</strong> In alignment with UC San Diego Library values, we celebrate creativity, risk-taking, and exploration. Collaborating with our team and community introduces new perspectives and inspires ideas that expand the boundaries of our work. We find joy and excitement in the creative process, taking on diverse projects that grow our personal frameworks and developing solutions that positively impact the larger UC San Diego community.</li>
        <li>&#x1F331; <strong>Create sustainable and holistic solutions.</strong> We adopt a holistic approach to our projects, diving beneath the surface to identify the root cause of problems and consider how solutions can be implemented across the organization and beyond. We are resourceful and forward-thinking, so that everything we create is intended to stand the test of time.</li>

    <div class="card-header">Learning and User Experience (LUE) Vision and Values</div>
  <div class="card-body">
      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>We partner with diverse campus communities, LUE, and library colleagues to design, build, and improve meaningful person-centered services, spaces, and learning opportunities in both the digital and physical library environments.</p>
      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p><em>In all aspects of our work, including service design and delivery, collaboration,  and interactions with users and colleagues, we embrace these values. </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Focus:</strong> We center the lived experiences of our users, broadly defined, in designing services and spaces, and actively partner with the campus communities to build programs that contribute to the mission of the University.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> We pursue experimentation and risk-taking for the opportunities they provide to meaningfully innovate, learn from mistakes and successes, meet the evolving needs of our users, and grow professionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> We are committed to continuous service improvement through regular evaluation and adapting to changing user needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> We value and incorporate  the diverse expertise, contributions, and perspectives of colleagues across LUE, the Library, and campus to encourage broad participation and engagement in designing meaningful collaborations, services, and solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> We approach each other and those we serve with compassion, understanding, and care, and strive to create spaces where people can show up authentically. </li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> We trust that all LUE colleagues share our vision to create positive user experiences and we show trust by genuinely seeking input, taking constructive feedback in good faith, and owning our impacts. </li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Articulating shared values</h3>
    <p class="card-text">Work together in a shared space, e.g., in a google doc or on a chalkboard, to co-articulate shared values.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take turns sharing your personal design values. What values do you have in common?</li>
        <li>Compare your personal values with the values of the Student Design Team and the Learning and User Experience Team. Are there any commonalities? Are there any differences?</li>
        <li>Use dot-voting, or a similar technique, to identify the values that resonate most with your team. See <a href="https://mindiply.com/blog/post/how-to-make-better-group-decision-with-dot-voting" target="_blank">examples of how to set up a dot-voting activity</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>Take the time to ask clarifying questions and also to up-vote the ideas that resonate with you.</li>
    </ol>
      <h2>Share your values!</h2>
<p>Leave a comment below with one or more of the ideas you created for your manifesto!</p>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't worry too much about exact wording at this point. The most useful manifestos are dynamic documents that evolve with your team. Plan on this being a working document for now, and then set up a time for your team to update and revise the document. Often working together for a time can bring forth important values and approaches.</li>
            <li>Have fun with this process! It can be a great way for a team to get to know each other and better understand other people's thought processes and ways of working.</li>
        </ul>
