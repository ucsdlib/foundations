title: Inclusive & Universal Design
---
<h2>What is inclusive design? What is universal design?</h2>

<p>Universal design calls for:</p>
    
<blockquote>The design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071827/http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm" target="_blank">The Center for Universal Design - NC State University, 1997</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Inclusive design describes:</p>

<blockquote>creating products that understand and enable people of all backgrounds and abilities. Inclusive design may address accessibility, age, culture, economic situation, education, gender, geographic location, language, and race. The focus is on fulfilling as many user needs as possible, not just as many users as possible (a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inclusive-design/" target="_blank">Nielsen Norman Group, 2022)</a>. </blockquote>

<p>Universal vs. inclusive design: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Inclusive design</strong> accepts and embraces multiple design variations so long as they achieve the desired outcome.</li>
	<li><strong>Universal design</strong> aims to create one experience that can be accessed and used to the greatest extent possible by all people. It forces a single design solution without need for adaptations or specialized design.</li>
</ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Exploring Inclusive Design</h3>
    <p>With your team, explore the diversity of designers, their experiences, and their different approaches to design by discussing the following questions and completing the follow activities together:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Have you ever had an experience that you felt just wasn't designed for you? How will this impact your personal design approach? How might this impact the team's design approach?</li>
		<li>Next, choose a website that your team frequently uses, and explore it with an eye for inclusive design. Here are a few examples:
		<blockquote>Accessibility: using WAVE - the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool: <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">http://wave.webaim.org/</a>. This tool gives you a chance to take a behind the scenes look at the accessibility of a website and identify both best practices and areas of improvement.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Readability: copy and paste some of the text from your chosen site into a Word document. (Ensure you have "readability stats" turned on by selecting <em>File --> Options</em> and under <em>Proofing</em>, checking <em>show readability statistics</em>.) Click <em>Review</em> and <em>Spelling and Grammar</em>to check the Flesch-Kincaid score. 100-90 is the easiest at a 5th grade reading level while 10-0 is the hardest at a professional or university graduate level.</blockquote>  
		<blockquote>Gender: are there any places where the site uses unnecessarily gendered language or relies solely on the gender binary?</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Race/Ethnicity: does the site use images or representations of people? If so, is the representation racially/ethnicall diverse?</blockquote>
		  <li>What did you notice about the website you visited? In what ways is it accessible? How could it be improved?</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Additional questions to discuss if you have time:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Imagine there were a tool like webaim for physical spaces, products, or services (in other words things that aren't online). How would it work? What factors would it consider? </li>
			<li>What roles do universal design and accessibility play in designs outside of the web? Can you think of a non-digital product or service that seems to have been created with universal design and accessibility in mind? What about the opposite?</li>
