<h2>Key Ideas in Learning and Teaching</h2>

<p>In this mini-course, we take a practical approach to learning and design theory by connecting the theories, which we call "key ideas," with your real life experiences.</p>

<p>In this section, we will start by looking closely at an example of classroom learning in a university lecture hall. We will use this example to explore several key ideas about learning, teaching, and design.</p>

<p>Then, you'll connect those key ideas with your own experiences as a learner, and share your experiences with your team.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you'll have started drafting a short narrative about a memorable, meaningful, or transformative experience in your life.</p>
