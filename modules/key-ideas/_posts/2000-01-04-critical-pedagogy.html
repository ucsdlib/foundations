title: Critical Pedagogy
---
<h2>What is critical pedagogy?</h2>

<p>Critical pedagogy involves critical questioning of the status quo, and often is focused on both transformation and promoting social change and social justice.</p>

<p>Proponents of critical pedagogy have argued that "teachers and students should be co-creators of knowledge within the classroom, and dominant ideologies should be exposed for critique and discussion" (Anderson & Herr, 2007).</p>

<p>These ideas challenge traditional conceptions of power and authority within the classroom itself and suggest new possibilities for learning and teaching.</p>

<p>The same is true for design and development. It's imperative to consider potential social and cultural implications of design decisions. This may mean ensuring you are hearing from diverse users and hearing diverse perspectives. This allows for the creation of inclusive solutions!</p>

    <p class="card-text">In your notebook, write a quick (3-5 minute) reflection on one or more of the following questions, and then select a few ideas to share with your team:</p>
	<ul>
	  	<li>In what ways does your design process involve going beneath "surface meaning, first impressions, and dominant myths"? What role does this type of critical thinking have in the design process and why might it be important?</li>
		<li>Have you ever experienced a design (e.g., of an object, product, service, advertisement, or environment) that seemed to be passing on a particular ideology or set of beliefs - either intentionally or unintentionally? If so, what was the context and what impact did it have on you?</li>
