title: Constructivism

<h2>What is constructivism?</h2>

<p>Constructivism sounds like a complex theory, but it is really about a couple of simple ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>we learn best when we actively <em>construct</em> or <em>build</em> knowledge, and that</li>
    <li>design involves making connections between our previous experiences and the new concepts we are learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this way our previous experiences are like a foundation or scaffolding which helps us understand new ideas and build on our design knowledge.</p>

<h2>What is social-constructivism?</h2>

<p>Social-Constructivism adds a <em>social</em> layer to constructivist approaches to learning. So, from a social constructivist perspective, we learn when we interact with each other to build knowledge.</p>

<p>These interactions - sharing our previous experiences, exploring ideas together, and collaboratively engaging with new concepts - are the key components of social knowledge building.</p>

<h2>How does this relate to design and development?</h2>
<p>We can apply these same theories to design and development, relating them to how we understand the user experience and the design interventions we choose. When faced with a user need or problem, we should think about our own experiences with the need or problem, and ask users about theirs. These help paint a picture of what may be informing the current need or problem.</p>
<p>Additionally, when designing an intervention, you will do a <em>landscape review</em> to see how our organization and others currently address the design. Digging a little deeper to see what other iterations were used previously will also surface great insights!</p>

    <p class="card-text">Choose 1-3 of the following questions. Then, in your notebook, write a quick, 3 minute reflection exploring your thoughts.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Can you think of an experience you have had (e.g., in an environment or with a product or service) where the designer built on your previous knowledge to allow you to do something new or achieve a personal goal?</li>
		<li>Often, different fields use different terms to talk about similar ideas. What language does the design world use to talk about constructivism and social-constructivism?</li>
		<li>Have you ever been in a designed environment (either online or in person) that encouraged building knowledge and understanding through social interaction? How did it work? What aspects of the design facilitated social constructivism? What would you have done differently if you had been the designer?</li>
		<li>In what ways does the design of this course encourage social-construtivist learning? How would you improve the design of this course to further incorporate social-constructivism?</li>
