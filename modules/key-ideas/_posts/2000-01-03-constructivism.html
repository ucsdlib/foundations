title: Constructivism
---

<h2>What is constructivism?</h2>

<p>Constructivism sounds like a complex learning theory, but it is really about a couple of simple ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>we learn best when we actively <em>construct</em> or <em>build</em> knowledge, and that</li>
    <li>design involves making connections between our previous experiences and the new concepts we are learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this way our previous experiences are like a foundation or scaffolding which helps us understand new ideas and build on our design knowledge.</p>

<h2>What is social-constructivism?</h2>

<p>Social-Constructivism adds a <em>social</em> layer to constructivist approaches to learning. So, from a social constructivist perspective, we learn when we interact with each other to build knowledge.</p>

<p>These interactions - sharing our previous experiences, exploring ideas together, and collaboratively engaging with new concepts - are the key components of social knowledge building.</p>

		<h4>Design for UX</h4>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Can you think of an experience you have had (e.g., in an environment or with a product or service) where the designer built on your previous knowledge to allow you to do something new or achieve a personal goal?</li>
		  <li>Often, different fields use different terms to talk about similar ideas. What language does the design world use to talk about constructivism and social-constructivism?</li>
		  <li>Have you ever been in a designed environment (either online or in person) that encouraged building knowledge and understanding through social interaction? How did it work? What aspects of the design facilitated social constructivism? What would you have done differently if you had been the designer?</li>
		  <li>In what ways does the design of this course encourage social-construtivist learning? How would you improve the design of this course to further incorporate social-constructivism?</li>
