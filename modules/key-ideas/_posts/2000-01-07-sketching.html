<p>Yay! Congratulations! You have almost made it through the "Key Ideas" section of Foundations! To wrap things up, here is a creative activity you can use to review and demonstrate your learning so far!</p>

<p>This section will give you an opportunity to sketch a redesign for the library in the physical or digital environment. Have fun making and creating as well as demonstrating all you have learned so far!</p>

<h2 id="design-for-ux">Design for UX: Sketching a Redesign</h2>

<p>To bring together your learning so far with a Design for UX focus, imagine you could redesign some aspect of the Library. For example, you might choose to redesign the entrance of Geisel Library, or redesign one of the Library's webpages!</p>

<p>Choose something to redesign, and create a very quick sketch of your redesign. Don't worry about artistry at all, instead, just focus on getting a few ideas on paper. As you sketch, consider all of the "key ideas" we have discussed so far. How can you incorporate one or more of these concepts into your design. Annotate your design with ideas and questions that come up for you.</p>

        <li>What was the most compelling aspect of the design for you? Why?</li>
        <li>Which ideas about design come through in the sketch for you?</li>
