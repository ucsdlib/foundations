<h2>When is design most memorable, meaningful, and transformative?</h2>

<p>We interact with designed objects and experiences every day. Some of these experiences are particularly special. Maybe it is special because we remember it for a long time, or because it has personal meaning and significance for us. Or maybe it was special because it fundamentally changed how we think, and, and create in the world.</p>
