         <h3 class="mt-3">Part 1</h3>
         <p class="card-text">Think about the stories shared in the previous activity. Work with your team to brainstorm a list of the characteristics of both positively experienced and negatively experienced design that you noticed in these stories. It might help you to think about how you would complete the following sentences:</p>
<blockquote>Design is most memorable when: ______________.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Design is most meaningful when: ______________.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Design is most transformative when: ______________.</blockquote>

        	<h4>Tips</h4>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Try completing the phrases from multiple perspectives, including the designers' and various user groups' as well as any motivational/contextual factors.</li>
        	</ul>

      <h3 class="mt-5">Part 2</h3>
      <p class="card-text">Next, share what you wrote with your teammates. Talk together with your team about the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What themes or categories are you noticing?</li>
            <li>How can we balance seemingly contradictory ideas?</li>
	<li>What are the most important ideas for you as a designer and creator?</li>
            <li>What are the most important ideas for you as a user?</li>
        </ul>

	<p class="card-text">Based on your discussions, create your own personal "Top-5" list of the characteristics of memorable, meaningful, and transformative <em>design</em> that are most relevant <em>specifically for you</em> for both positively and negatively experienced design. Write this list down in your notebook. We will come back to this list later when you make your manifesto!</p>

<!-- todo: consider integrating tech training at end of each section. e.g., what if there were a simple github site to gather characteristics - the compiled results appearing on this page? then there could be an activity here to learn github editing, etc? -->
