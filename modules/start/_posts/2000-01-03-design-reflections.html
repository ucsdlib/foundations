title: Design Reflections

<h2>When is design most memorable, meaningful, and transformative?</h2>

<p>We interact with designed objects and experiences every day. Some of these experiences are particularly special. Maybe it is special because we remember it for a long time, or because it has personal meaning and significance for us. Or maybe it was special because it fundamentally changed how we think, act, and create in the world. And these experiences can be special in both positive and negative ways.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What was the design?</li>

        <li>Who was involved?</li>
        <li>What was the environment like?</li>
	<li>What impact did the design have on your experience?</li>
        <li>What other impressions or memories do you have of your interaction with this design?</li>

    <h3 class="card-title">Share your story</h3>
    <p class="card-text">When you finish, share your experiences with a member of your team. As you share, look for similarities and differences based on your experiences.</p>
	<p class="card-text">Then, think about your various identities (sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc.). Are your personal experiences similar or different than your teammates based on any of them? </p>
	<p class="card-text">Finally, while we can never fully know the experience of someone who identifies differently than us, think about someone who may. How might their experience with your chosen designs be similar or different?</p>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>Be sure to listen first, and then comment, question, and engage with the ideas shared by your teammates.</p>
