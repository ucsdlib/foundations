<h2>Welcome to Foundations!</h2>

<p>In this mini-course you will explore inclusive design by completing a series of practical, creative, and hands-on activities. Along the way, you will write about and discuss your learning experiences, reflect on key ideas in teaching and learning, and roll your sleeves up to start creating storyboards and prototypes.</p>

<h2>What will we learn?</h2>

<p>As you actively engage with the activities in this mini-course, you will strengthen your ability to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Relate key ideas in design to your own personal experiences</li>
	<li>Map out the challenges, breakthroughs, and outcomes in a learning process</li>
	<li>Center your designs around users of all backgrounds and abilities</li>
</ul>

<p>As you learn, you and your team will also create a<strong>design manifesto</strong> and turn your design ideas into <strong>storyboards and prototypes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Who should take this course?</h2>

<p>This course was adapted from the UCLA WI+RE team, a learner-led design team at UCLA. The initial version of the training was created by Doug Worsham and Shannon roux.</p>
<p>This version is intended for use by the UC San Diego Library's TDX Student Design Team. The purpose of Foundations is to guide team members through your onboarding process through this foundational training.</p>
<p>This mini-course was created with small teams in mind, and as such many of the activities involve talking and collaborating with other team members. While you can take the course as an individual, it is more fun, and more effective, to take it with at least one other person.</p>

<h2>How long will it take?</h2>

<p>Each module of the mini-course should take about 90 minutes, but could take longer, depending on how deep you dive into the discussion, and how involved you get in the creative process.</p>
