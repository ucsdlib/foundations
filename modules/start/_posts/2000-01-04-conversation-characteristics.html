         <h3 class="mt-3">Part 1</h3>
         <p class="card-text">Think about the stories shared in the previous activity. Work with your team to brainstorm a list of the characteristics of design you noticed in these stories. It might help you to think about how you would complete the following sentences for design:</p>
	  <h4>Design for UX:</h4>
         <blockquote>Design is most memorable when: ______________.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Design is most meaningful when: ______________.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Design is most transformative when: ______________.</blockquote>

      <p class="card-text">Next, share what your wrote with your teammates. Talk together with your team about the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What themes or categories are you noticing?</li>
            <li>How can we balance seemingly contradictory ideas?</li>
			      <li>What are the most important ideas for you as a designer and creator?</li>
            <li>What are the most important ideas for you as a user?</li>
        </ul>

<!-- todo: consider integrating tech training at end of each section. e.g., what if there were a simple github site to gather characteristics - the compiled results appearing on this page? then there could be an activity here to learn github editing, etc? -->
