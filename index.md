## Want to make something useful?

This mini-course is a hands-on, team-based introduction to user-centered design. It was created to help you quickly develop creative and reflective approaches to inclusive design. 

By the end of this mini-course you and your team will have a deeper understanding of design, a shared vocabulary to talk about your ideas, and a user-centered design process to help you develop great work together. We will also practice rapid-prototyping, storyboarding, and constructive feedback techniques to expand your team's design toolkbox.
